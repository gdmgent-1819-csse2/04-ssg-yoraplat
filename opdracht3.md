## Refactor code
# What is refactoring?
Refactoring is rewriting your code to make it more efficient and easier to read. Easy to read code is usefull for others to comprehend what you exactly did. But it's also better for yourself if you can clearly see what you did. Comments are also very usefull to create clean code, but only write comments if they're really usefull for the person reading them. Otherwise this might lead to confusion.  

# Names

Functions, variables, classes etc should have clear names. Every name has to clearly state what it is or will do, there has to be a distinct difference between names. Programming specific words should be avoided in order to prevent confusion.

# Functions

Functions only have to do one thing, but they have to do it correctly without any possible side-effects. When using parameters in a function you should limit the amount of parameters to maximum 2. If you really have to use more than 2 parameters, try to use objects or lists.

# Loops

Loops should only contain one rule each. Try to not nest loops in your functions.

# Error Handling

Use exceptions to catch any possible errors.
